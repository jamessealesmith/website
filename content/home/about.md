# Biography

Hi! I’m pursing a Ph.D. in Machine Learning at Georgia Tech. I graduated with my 
bachelor’s (May 2017) and master’s (May 2018) degrees from Auburn University. While working 
under Dr. Bogdan M. Wilamowski, I completed my thesis focused in deep learning algorithms and 
architectures for practical deployment. 
I enjoy getting my hands dirty in machine learning with projects ranging from creating a 
raspberry pi animal detection system to developing a second-order optimization 
algorithm.  Outside of school, I enjoy racing triathlons, marathons, and even 
ultramarathon distance races!

This page is still a work in progress. Please {{% staticref "files/cv.pdf" "newtab" %}}read my cv{{% /staticref %}} for a complete overview of my work.
