# Biography

Hi! I’m pursing a Ph.D. in Machine Learning at Georgia Tech. I graduated with my bachelor’s (May 2017) and master’s (May 2018) degrees from Auburn University. Working under Dr. Bogdan M. Wilamowski, my thesis focused in deep learning algorithms and architectures for practical deployment. 
I enjoy getting my hands dirty in machine learning with projects ranging from a raspberry pi animal detection system to developing a second-order optimization algorithm.  Outside of school, I enjoy racing triathlons, marathons, and even ultramarathon distance races!

This page is still a work in progress. Read my {{% staticref "files/cv.pdf" "newtab" %}}cv{{% /staticref %}} for a complete overview of my work.
