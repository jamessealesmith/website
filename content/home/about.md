# Biography

I am a <a href="https://ml.gatech.edu/phd">Machine Learning Ph.D.</a> student at Georgia Tech advised by <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~zk15/">Zsolt Kira</a>. I graduated with my 
bachelor’s (May 2017) and master’s (May 2018) degrees from Auburn University. My research involves lifelong machine learning using limited supervision. Specifically, I am working to build algorithms which can rapidly learn to identify new objects from a visual data stream with very few semantic queues. This will benefit any application involving real-time learning, such as autonomous vehicles or fraud detection and monitoring.
My most recent project (under the direction of <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Constantinos.Dovrolis/">Constantine Dovrolis</a>) looks at learning data representations from a non-stationary stream of unlabeled data for downstream classification tasks (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02021">click here for arXiv link</a>).
