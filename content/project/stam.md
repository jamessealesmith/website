This project, </a> (under the direction of <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Constantinos.Dovrolis/">Constantine Dovrolis</a>), looks at learning data representations from a non-stationary stream of unlabeled data for downstream classification tasks. This work has resulted in two workshop publications:

Smith, J., Baer, S., Taylor, C., & Dovrolis, C. (2020). Unsupervised Progressive Learning and the STAM Architecture. Lifelong Learning Workshop, ICML 2020.

Smith, J., Baer, S., Kira, Z., & Dovrolis, C. (2019). Unsupervised Continual Learning and Self-Taught Associative Memory Hierarchies. Learning with Limited Labeled Data Workshop, ICLR 2019.
