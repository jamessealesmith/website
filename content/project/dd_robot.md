Visualization and Simulation are key strategies for quick and effective algorithm development and problem solving.  In the realm of differential-drive robotics (DDR), new path-planning and navigation algorithms are quickly emerging as intelligent systems are reimagined.  In order to speed the development process and produce low-cost, realistic visualization for path-planning and navigation algorithms for DDR, a novel Matlab differential-drive robotics simulation environment is created which combines realistic simulation conditions and simplistic deployment.
