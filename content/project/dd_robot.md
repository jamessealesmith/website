Visualization and Simulation are key strategies for quick and effective algorithm
development and problem solving.  In the realm of differential-drive robotics (DDR),
new path-planning and navigation algorithms are quickly emerging as intelligent systems
are reimagined.  In order to speed the development process and produce low-cost,
realistic visualization for path-planning and navigation algorithms for DDR,
I have developed a Matlab differential-drive robotics simulation environment
which combines realistic simulation conditions and simplistic deployment. 

I plan to use this environment to explore path planning and reinforcement learning
algorithms. Although the environment is completed with simple path planning algorithms
such as A*, I have not finished programming reinforcement learning algorithms such as
Sarsa and Q-Learning.

My code for this project can be found at http://github.com/jamessealesmith/robotics_sim/
