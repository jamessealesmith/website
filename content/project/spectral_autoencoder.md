I've enjoyed looking at spectral pooling (and unpooling) during my master's to create 
lossy deep learning networks. Not everybody needs to use the state of the art network for 
their project! You can check out {{% staticref "files/smith_wishum_review.pdf" "newtab" %}}this review{{% /staticref %}} 
I coauthored on the original spectral pooling paper to learn more.

For my digital image processing class project, I experimented with spectral pooling for 
deep convolutional autoencoder implementations. {{% staticref "files/spectral_dae.pdf" "newtab" %}}Check it out here{{% /staticref %}}!
