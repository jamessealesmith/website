abstract = "This paper presents an optimization method used to design antennas capable of broadcasting electromagnetic energy in specific, predefined regions of space. These types of highly directional antennas are very beneficial in tracking radars where maximum “power on target” is crucial for telecommunication systems trying to maximize coverage. The presented method involves using a technique known as a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a “branching tree antenna,” where the antenna wire configuration resembles the branch structure of a tree. The advantage of our method is that it allows antennas to branch in arbitrary directions with no symmetrical constraints applied in other methods. This paper also lays out a systematic approach to developing an objective function for any desired power pattern. Telecommunication systems and specifically cellular towers trying to focus the signal power in populated areas and eliminate coverage in unpopulated areas (city reservoirs, landfills, etc.) will greatly benefit from these antenna designs."
