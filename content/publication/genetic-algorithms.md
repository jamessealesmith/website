abstract = "The goal of this research is to find the optimal number, length, orientation, and placement of straight wires to create a multiple element antenna capable of focusing radiated power (i.e., Gain) in very specific sectors of space (Antenna footprint). Antennas are transducers that convert electrical current to radiated electromagnetic power and focus power in specific directions. The radiated power from antennas is typically represented in a three-dimensional pattern (radiation pattern). An ideal radiation pattern sought by engineers is one that maximizes the coverage in one area, thus focusing all of the power from the antenna in that direction (minimal power radiated in undesired directions). It is not the case with antennas that the simpler designs are always best; generally, more complex antenna designs are required to produce highly directional radiation patterns. The solution space for such a complex antenna is infinitely large and risks convergence on non-optimal solutions with many optimization techniques. In order to search such a solution space, this research utilizes a Genetic Algorithm (GA), an optimization technique that mimics natural selection occurring in nature. This research differs from similar projects in that we allow the antenna to “branch out”, similar to a large tree. This further increases the potential for more desirable antenna patterns by increasing the solution space that our GA must search. Using this technique, we have been able to produce desired radiation patterns from complex, multi-bend antenna solutions. This research can be replicated with various desired radiation patterns for use in various industries, such as cellular towers and geometry-specific wireless data transfers."
